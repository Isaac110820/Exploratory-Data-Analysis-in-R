# Exploratory Data Analysis in R

This project demonstrates a variety of data exploration techniques using three different data sets: 

-	The “comics” data set which contains information on all comic characters that have been introduced by DC and Marvel is used to explore **categorical data**.
-	The “cars” data set which contains information on all new models of cars for sale in the US in a certain year is used to explore **numerical data**.
-	The “gapminder” data set which contains information on demographic data in various countries throughout the world is used to explore **numerical summaries**. 

All data sets can be found in the repository.
